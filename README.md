Project Title
This project processes a list of names and performs operations using a neural network with PyTorch. The project demonstrates fundamental operations such as tokenizing names, building mappings, and using PyTorch for basic deep learning tasks.

Project Structure
AK_03_mark1-Copy2.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for processing names and performing model operations.
names.txt: A text file with a list of names. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the notebook to allow successful reading.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
PyTorch
Other dependencies: matplotlib
Setup Instructions
Clone or Download the Project

Download the project files and place them in a directory.
Ensure names.txt is present in the directory to avoid errors.
Install Required Libraries

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory, then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch matplotlib jupyter
Running the Project

Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Then, open the AK_03_mark1-Copy2.ipynb notebook and run the cells sequentially.

Project Details

The notebook loads names.txt and performs preprocessing to map characters to indices.
It uses PyTorch to implement functions and operations related to character sequences.
Visualization: Plots are generated using Matplotlib for insights into data processing steps.
Notes

Ensure that all required files are in the same directory as the notebook.
If you encounter any errors related to missing files or packages, verify the setup instructions.
