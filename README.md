# Name Generator

This project processes a list of names and performs operations using a neural network with PyTorch. The project demonstrates fundamental operations such as tokenizing names, building mappings, and using PyTorch for basic deep learning tasks.

## Project Structure
name_generator.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for processing names and performing model operations.
names.txt: A text file with a list of names. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the notebook to allow successful reading.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
PyTorch
Other dependencies: matplotlib

## Setup Instructions
Clone the Project

```
git clone https://github.com/Preetham0531/Name-Generator
```

## Install Required Libraries

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory, then run:

```
pip install torch matplotlib jupyter
```

Running the Project

Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the name_generator.ipynb notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Project Details

The notebook loads names.txt and performs preprocessing to map characters to indices.
It uses PyTorch to implement functions and operations related to character sequences.
Visualization: Plots are generated using Matplotlib for insights into data processing steps.
Notes

Ensure that all required files are in the same directory as the notebook.
If you encounter any errors related to missing files or packages, verify the setup instructions.
